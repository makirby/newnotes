# Notes
List of notes/ general musings for react native devlopment.

## Icons
May be worth looking at Vector Icons [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) as it seems to solve a few problems with the default implementation of 'react-native-icons'

## Forms
Potentially can use the form helper module [Here](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb-form-native) to help build this complex models & generate forms to represent them.
### Validation
There is a lib called Validate.JS that can be ised to provide validation on JS objects relatively easliy. The project is found [here](https://validatejs.org/)
## Testing
A library called Jest is the de-facto standard for React/Native testing, allowing you to programmatically change the props used by JSX components. Can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
